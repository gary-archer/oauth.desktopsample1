## Overview

An initial cross-platform demo desktop app using AppAuth and OpenID Connect.

## Views

The app is a simple UI with some basic navigation between views, to render fictional investment resources.\
Its data is returned from an OAuth-secured API that uses claims-based authorization.\
The app uses user attributes from both the OpenID Connect userinfo endpoint and its API.

## Local Development Quick Start

First ensure that Node.js 20+ is installed.\
Then build and run the app via this command, to trigger an OpenID Connect desktop flow:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Run the app to trigger an OpenID Connect code flow to authenticate the user with the AppAuth pattern.\
The login runs in the default system browser and the app cannot access the user's credentials:

You can login to the desktop app using my AWS Cognito test account:

```text
- User: guestuser@example.com
- Password: GuestPassword1
```

The app receives the login response using a loopback redirect URI.\
After login you can test some basic lifecycle operations, though session management is incomplete.

## Further Information

- See blog posts for further details, starting in the [Initial Desktop Sample Overview](https://apisandclients.com/posts/desktop-apps-overview).
- See the [Final Desktop Sample](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.desktopsample.final) for a more complete desktop app.

## Programming Languages

* The app uses the Electron framework with TypeScript code.

## Infrastructure

* The [AppAuth-JS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS/blob/master/README.md) library is used to implement the code flow with PKCE.
* [AWS Serverless](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.apisample.serverless) or Kubernetes host remote API endpoints that the app calls.
* AWS Cognito is used as the default authorization server for the desktop app and API.
